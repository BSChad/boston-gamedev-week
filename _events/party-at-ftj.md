Whether you just finished with [Demo Night](demo-night) or [GodotCon](godotcon), join us for drinks and laid back conversation.

Hosted by Boston Game Dev, this is a casual hangout at our favorite local haunt. They've got pinball, pool, indoor space, and outdoor space. They've got a full food menu.

- **Boston Indies** is the indie focused arm of Boston Game Dev. Each month we do talks, show off our work, or enjoy coffee or drinks in service of growing Boston's independent game development community.
