A casual drop-in Zoom call from 5pm to 6pm Eastern on Wednesday 7 May.

(That’s the day before Pax East opens.) 

The call is meant to be useful for anyone with interest, and in particular for those who might want to meet on Thursday 8 May at the show. I’m walking sighted guide for a blind friend, so any meeting at the show is a 2-for-1 deal. He’s cool, and I’m bearable.
