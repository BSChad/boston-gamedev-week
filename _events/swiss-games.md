excerpt: Join us for an exclusive evening at the Swiss Mixer @ PAX East, where creativity, ambition, and international opportunity converge!

This special event invites PAX East attendees and game enthusiasts to network with two emerging Swiss game studios, the Swiss Game Developers Association (SGDA), and Greater Zurich Area (GZA), and to explore the vibrant gaming landscapes of Switzerland and the United States.

This is a unique opportunity to meet ambitious game developers who are pushing the boundaries of storytelling, design, and technology in Switzerland and the US. Featured projects include “In Full Bloom,” a visually stunning and emotionally rich game experience developed by students at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK), and Kipwak Studio, an exciting new game studio blending strong narrative worlds with playful, engaging mechanics.

Both projects are supported by Pro Helvetia, the Swiss arts council, which fosters the development of emerging talent and promotes Swiss innovation in the global creative industries.

Come discover how Swiss talent is innovating across genres and platforms, and hear about fostering cross-continental collaborations, improving funding opportunities, and the growing impact of Switzerland’s gaming industry. Whether you are a developer, publisher, investor, educator, or simply a fan of gaming innovation, you’ll find inspiration and new connections here.

Enjoy a relaxed atmosphere, light refreshments, and great conversations with peers who are passionate about building the future of games.
