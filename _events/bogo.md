A special edition of the Boston Godot Developers Group at Flat Top Johnny's. Instead of lightning talks, let's hang out with our out of town GodotCon folks.

Space is limited. Please RSVP.

Are you a game developer working with Godot, or interested in learning more about the open-source game engine thatâ€™s been gaining popularity? Come and connect with like-minded enthusiasts at our monthly meetup! Whether you're deep into game development or just starting to explore the possibilities of Godot, this is the perfect opportunity to share your projects, learn from others, and network with fellow developers.

This month we have a special edition! Instead of meeting at the NERD, let's skip the talking and get straight to the socializing along with our GodotCon family. This is a great way to unwind from a day of workshops or prepare for the next two days of talks. There might just be some special guests in attendance.
