Relaxing Chats East 2025!

**Every year, a lot of super cool developers come to Boston for PAX East. Wouldn't it be great if there were a peaceful location set aside where you could sit down with them and chat for a day?**

Well, you are in the right place!

### Format
Relaxing Chats East is a series of topic-driven roundtable discussions consisting of roughly 12 people each for 90 minutes.

### Where
We have rented several rooms near South Station, a few blocks from the convention center. We will tell you where to go after you have signed up for a chat on the schedule. This event is not open to the general public. You must sign up  for the schedule and receive an invitation. 

### Cost
It’s free! But don’t hesitate to [donate to Boston Game Dev](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/boston-game-dev-inc/boston-game-dev) if you want to support stuff like this in the future. Also, your donation is tax deductible! 

### Date 
May 6th and May 9th

### How do I RSVP? 
<span style="color: #d52991;">**Sign up now by April 1st to get yourself into a chat.**</span> After that date, we will send out invites to let you know which chats you are invited to attend, and exactly where they are. All chats are within walking distance of south station.

Our space is limited. Depending on how many people apply it's possible not everyone will get to attend. That said, we will attempt to make sure everyone who applies gets to go to at least 1 chat.
