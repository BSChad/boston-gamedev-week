Microsoft New England Research and Development Center is a space open to non-profits to hold events. Attendees must sign in at the lobby, providing an ID, and then take the elevators up to the Mezzanine. (M on the elevator.)

### Parking
There is limited street parking in front of the building. It is in Kendall Square, so there is also limited street parking within a 5 - 10 minute walk.

There is a Microsoft Garage directly below the building. It is for employees "and friends".

### Harassment Policy

If you experience any harassment or other disrespectful behavior, please report it to the host of the event, any of Boston Game Dev's socials through direct messaging, or speak with any staff at the event.
